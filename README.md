# WiBD-Disaster-Tweets-Project
I joined the Women in Big Data group. Our team was called "Team Square Roots."  We completed the Kaggle Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started.  Challenge:   Supervised learning on a NLP dataset.  Using a dataset of labelled tweets, learn to categorize tweets as being about a disaster or not.
